This project helps to understand how to build a basic push notification application.
It has two parts:
    - pushServer
    - the react part

## push-server
    - Open the command prompt in windows and go to the given project directory.
    - cd push-server
    - npm i
    - set CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 && node src/server.js ( to give the cross origin access)
    - the server runs on port 8080

## react-part
    - Open the command prompt in windows and go to the given project directory.
    - npm i
    - npm start
    - the application runs on port 3000
